# Deploy a Working Random Password Generator Using javaScript

### Individually implement the project for the following USER story:

* AS AN employee with access to sensitive data I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain  criteria SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security.

## Acceptance Criteria 

### GIVEN a USER need a new, secure password

* WHEN the USER click the button to generate a password THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
* WHEN prompted for password criteria THEN the USER selects which criteria to include in the password
* WHEN prompted for the length of the password THEN the USER chooses a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
* WHEN asked for character types to include in the password THEN the USER confirms whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
* WHEN the USER answers each prompt THEN their input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
* WHEN all prompts are answered THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
* WHEN the password is generated THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
